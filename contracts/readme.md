## Vision

The ELibrary project aims to create a decentralized digital library that allows users to upload, manage, and share digital books on the Ethereum blockchain. By utilizing blockchain technology and IPFS for storage, ELibrary ensures that digital content is securely stored, immutable, and accessible to anyone worldwide without the need for intermediaries. This project promotes the democratization of knowledge and information through decentralized technology.

## Future Scope

1. **Search & Filter**: Implement search functionality to allow users to find books by title, author, or other metadata.
2. **Borrowing Mechanism**: Introduce a decentralized borrowing system where users can borrow and return books, possibly with a staking mechanism.
3. **User Ratings & Reviews**: Allow users to rate and review books, creating a community-driven rating system.
4. **Monetization**: Enable authors to sell digital books or access to their content through the platform, with payments handled via smart contracts.
5. **Advanced IPFS Integration**: Improve IPFS integration for faster retrieval and possibly support for metadata storage.
